39293,Contrave,Weight Loss,"""Contrave combines drugs that were used for alcohol, smoking, and opioid cessation. People lose weight on it because it also helps control over-eating. I have no doubt that most obesity is caused from sugar/carb addiction, which is just as powerful as any drug. I have been taking it for five days, and the good news is, it seems to go to work immediately. I feel hungry before I want food now. I really don&#039;t care to eat; it&#039;s just to fill my stomach. Since I have only been on it a few days, I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ve lost weight (I don&#039;t have a scale), but my clothes do feel a little looser, so maybe a pound or two.

Ginanvi had cleared up my acne in the short time I used and I was hoping this birth control would not mess that up. I was wrong. After 2-3 months of using this pill my skin went crazy with horrible breakouts. Now, 9 months later I still have horrible acne. If you want a pill that helps with acne this is NOT it. It also made my period &quot;weird&quot;. I would have little to no period one month and a heavy one the next . The month that I had a heavier flow my boobs would hurt a lot.

MD informed me after this dose it becomes less effective for sleep, so why even bother.  15 years of trying different sleep medications and alternatives, and this, I can say for sure, was the LEAST effective I have ever come across.

I was trying to figure out if something else in my life was affecting me, I even went to my therapist and a depression care specialist. I finally read some reviews on the copper IUD and depression and it seems pretty common. Drs will tell you it&#039;s not the IUD but please trust your intuition.

Additionally, it causes constipation even in low doses, which can contribute to further gastrointestinal pain.""",9,31-May-14,20

The warts seemed to get bigger at the start but quickly vanished and now i have no visible warts at all! I used Warticon before and it did absolutely nothing, so i was thrilled to see something finally working. Give it time and patience. One word of advice,  i used this cream and got cryotherapy done around the same time. I would wait a week or so after cryo, apply the cream for a few weeks, then repeat of necessary. This seemed to really help.""",8,02-Nov-15,12

She was very good during the insertion about letting me know when pain would occur. It was very painful for about 3-4 hours. After that, it was similar to my normal cramps for 2 days. I spotted for the first 4 days just enough for a panty liner, not even a pad, and have not had any spotting since.

Prior to taking Lisinopril my blood pressure was around 135/75.  As the amount of Lisinopril was increased my blood pressure kept increasing. After 40 days it was around 175/85 (maximum 200/100).

24509,Polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes,Bowel Preparation,"""My colonoscopy was booked in for late afternoon on a Thursday. The hospital said to stop eating anything from 1pm on the Wednesday and recommended (giving some detail) a non fibre diet from Tuesday evening until Wednesday noon - avoiding dark drinks and jelly (like blackcurrant flavour). Avoid red meat, sausages and pies; fruit, vegetables and salad; potato skins or fries, wholemeal or brown bread; nuts, pulses, baked beans; wholemeal pasta, brown rice; puddings containing fruit or nuts; cakes and biscuits, yoghurts. Preferred are white skinless meat like chicken, grilled or poached fish, cheese, eggs; white bread, pasta, rice; boiled or mashed potatoes, water, fizzy drinks, fruit squash (not blackcurrant), clear soups, tea or coffee, shredless marmalade or jam, ice cream, custard, clear jelly, butter, margarine. 

The hospital also instructed me to start taking Moviprep, one packet (A + B) at 7pm Wednesday evening; and then another packet (A+B) starting from 6am Thursday. On each occasion I was told to drink the mixture at 250ml a time over 1 to 2 hours. On each occasion I was also to take 500ml of clear water AND to take some sugary drinks to maintain blood sugar levels &ndash; non-diet carbonated drinks i.e. Coca Cola, Lucozade, or ginger ale, any other clear sugary fluids such as clear apple juice (but NOT other fruit juices); water alone not being sufficient. A spoonful of honey is suggested if sugary drinks are not liked.

On Wednesday evening I mixed the two Moviprep packets (A + B) with 1 litre of water in a large jug. It tasted mildly of lemon but, because of warnings about taste, I downed each 250ml in seconds (rather than sip it) so as not to have to agonise over the taste. Starting at 7am the fourth dose was finished at 8pm. The drug started having an effect at about 7.45pm and thereafter it was a matter of getting to the lavatory frequently and quickly for about 3 to 4 hours. I went to bed at midnight but had to get up again at 2am and two more occasions up to 4am; though not in so much of a hurry. I took the 500ml of water after the final dose and about 250ml of Lucozade after that.  I was also told to use, what we in the UK, call vaseline to prevent soreness of skin on the buttocks. This I did not do but regretted it. Just before midnight I was so sore that I did apply some vaseline ready for Thursday morning and it paid dividends. 

On Thursday morning I went through the same procedure again applying the vaseline again before starting. This time the emissions were yellow and eventually pretty clear. Also the emissions pretty much (though not entirely) finished by 8am, much quicker than the night before. I can only assume there was nothing left to eject. All in all it was not a pleasant chore but a fair price to pay to get the job done.""",10,17-Mar-16,42

Within minutes of taking a pill, my nausea subsides. The only side effect I&#039;ve experienced has been constipation, but I&#039;ll take that over vomiting any day!

I cut my pill in half for a few weeks, then stopped taking it. No withdrawal symptoms. I then decided to keep taking 1 mg but its comforting for me to know that I&#039;m not dependent on it.

227160,Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had Implanon for almost 3 years and had it removed today. I loved this birth control because it completely got rid of my period, and cramps. On the pill, I had awful cramps and would spend days in bed, on Implanon, cramps NEVER bothered me. My only complaint with the Implanon was major weight gain. Over the past three years I&#039;ve gained quite a bit of weight and this is the only reason I&#039;m moving back to the pill. If you&#039;re worried about weight gain, do not use  Implanon.""",7,"April 9, 2014",10

227453,Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""It&#039;s the most effective for not falling pregnant. I heard people getting pregnant on everything but the Implanon. It&#039;s 99.9% effective. I had fun with it. No kids and all the fun you can have. I have one child when I was 16 and got the Implanon right after I had him. I was too young and need to make sure I have no more for a while. When I get in my late 20s I will have another child but for now no. I&#039;m 19 and too young.""",9,"April 28, 2013",8

1509,Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,"""This is my second time on this medication. For some background, I have had IBS my whole life and had many tests done and tried all kinds of diets to try and help and nothing worked. I used to go to the bathroom 6-8 times a day (sometimes more, usually with cramps) I used to take bentyl but it makes me feel very sleepy and groggy. I took the 75mg for awhile but it became less effective so now I&#039;m on the 100mg and it works a lot better and I&#039;m down to going to the bathroom about twice a day with minimal or no cramps through out the day. The only side effect I have had is that about 10 minutes after taking the pill I feel weird, like a weird feeling, mostly in my upper back/shoulders. It goes away pretty quickly and doesn&#039;t hurt.""",9,23-Aug-17,11
177493,Duloxetine,Depression,"""Cymbalta 120mg for 4 months
Good:
- slight to moderate increase in motivation, mental energy and attention/alertness.
- decrease in anxiety and depressive feelings.
Bad:
- made me less social, less empathetic and more robotic.
- horrible withdrawal symptoms which happen quickly if you forget to take it.
- when my dosage was increased from 30mg to 60mg, it started to give me nightmares at night and caused me to wake up in middle of the night and lose sleep.

Conclusion: Better positive cognitive experience than 10mg Escitalopram which other than positively affecting my mood, all it did was cause constant brain fogs and decrease my motivation even further.""",8,28-Feb-16,21

101806,Terbinafine,"Onychomycosis, Toenail","""I am on my third month of taking Lamisil.  I had no side effects for the first two months and now I have frequent diarrhea (every day).  I just don&#039;t understand why I am now getting the side effects.  I am always thirsty, feel dehydrated and have a bad taste in my mouth most of the time.  Slight headaches here and there.  Did anyone else have side effects that came after two months?  Luckily this should be my last refill of this medication.  I haven&#039;t noticed any positive changes in my middle infected toenail, but a friend who took the medication advised me that it could take six months or longer for a new nail to grow in.

I take 0.5mg, but when I take it, my anxiety goes away. I feel like I can do anything, with a clear mind of course. I don&#039;t have to hide away anymore. I thought this drug might make me &quot;stoned&quot; or something, but really all I experience is, after about 15 min, a general clear-minded sense of well-being and it works for a while. Good stuff.""",10,07-Aug-15,70
